Note: For this code to work it needs to be integrated with the frontend code and also connected to MongoDB. This repo should go in a root folder and the frontend code
can go in a folder called "client" and connect to the backend via a proxy. I had created a similar app on my laptop earlier but it was deleted.

The exact path for the frontend code for this CRUD app: https://github.com/Tutorials-Snippets/loizenai-Frontend-CRUD-React.js/tree/main/Reactjs-Nodejs-MongoDB-CRUD-Example
